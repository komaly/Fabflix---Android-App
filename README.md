This is an android app that emulates some features of the Fabflix website.

The app opens up with a login page, and the user types in the login page for a 
specific user from the MySQL database. For example, type in "a@email.com" for the 
username and "a2" for the password. It then directs to a search activity page,
where the user searches for movie names. After typing in a name and pressing 
search, a table with a list of movies and it's details is shown in the next 
activity. The screen can be scrolled to the right to view more details of the 
table. 10 results are shown per page. There is a previous and next button
to go back and forth between pages.
